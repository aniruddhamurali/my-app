                <h5>How Does It All Work? What was the Process?</h5>
                <div><strong>The General Idea:</strong></div>
                <p>
                    This one is a bit tough to explain in a few words so I will start off by discussing concepts
                    that are relevant to the project. In investing, the term exposure refers to the risk of a 
                    particular investment in some derivative. There are two kinds of exposure we are concerned
                    with: potential exposure and current exposure. Current exposure (CE) is the exposure of a derivative
                    at the current moment in time. Potential exposure (PE) is the exposure we predict. For instance, if 
                    we are looking at 2 week PE, that means we are predicting the exposure 2 weeks from now. We have 
                    something called an exception every time the CE is greater than the PE because that means the actual 
                    risk exceeded the risk we predicted - this is where you could lose money. Since that is concerning, we 
                    want to see where our models had exceptions and analyze those exceptions to understand why they occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the team I was on, a big part of their job is to analyze these exceptions using their elaborate 
                    exception investigation process. During my internship, I also helped out with these tasks. One insight I 
                    found was that some stocks had exceptions because of various COVID news. There were some instances, for 
                    example, where the stock increased higher than expcted because of either higher than expected employment 
                    growth or positive vaccine news. These stocks were on the buy side - you want to buy for as low as 
                    possible, so higher risk is associated with higher prices. However, on the sell side, you want to sell 
                    for as high as possible, so higher risk is associated with lower prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This process is extremely tedious. You have to look at all exceptions for various derivatives in various 
                    product groups, so it takes a vary long time. This is where my project comes into play. I worked on 
                    developing clustering algorithms that could cluster exceptions of various derivatives based on the times 
                    and magnitudes of those exceptions. My proposal was that instead of investigating exceptions one at a time,
                    you could instead investgiate clusters of exceptions at a time; since the exceptions in each cluster are 
                    similar, there's a good chance that the reasoning for those exceptions are also similar. In fact, this was 
                    something I noticed while helping with the investigation process, which is why I worked on presenting this 
                    proposal.

                <div><strong>The Algorithms:</strong></div>
                <p>
                    In clustering, you run some sort of algorithm that groups data points together into clusters based 
                    on some sort of similarity metric you use to compare data points. During my internship, I primarily  
                    worked with two clustering: K-means and hierachical clustering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In K-Means, you perform the following steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Determine the number of clusters k.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Choose k data points at random and assign each point to its own cluster.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Assign each of the remaining data points to one of the k clusters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Compute the cluster centroids (middle of the cluster) by averaging all the 
                            data points
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repeat the following until you've reached a certain number of iterations:
                            <li>
                                Assign each data point to a cluster based on the calculated centroids that 
                                represent the new clusters
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Calculate the centroids of these clusters using the data points in the cluster 
                            </li>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two approaches to hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive. The approach I 
                    used was agglomerative (bottom-up):
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Assign each data point to its own cluster. If you have n data points, you should have n 
                            clusters at the beginning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Merge the closest pair of clusters. Closest pair is based on the similarity metric you use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keep repeating the above step until you are left with one cluster left.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At this point, you have a "hierarchy" of clusters - you have what the clusters look like for 
                            n clusters, n-1 clusters, ..., 2 clusters, and 1 cluster. Use an index to determine which 
                            number of clusters resulting in the best clustering.
                        </li>
                    </ol> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, we have to provide these clustering algorithms with a similarity metric to work with. 
                    For each derivative, I calculated the CE-PE for each date - this gives a value that determines 
                    if there was an exception or not. So, when comparing various derivatives, we are comparing the 
                    similarity of the CE-PE line graphs for those derivatives. Here are some similarity metrics I 
                    tested out:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Correlation: We calculate the R-value of the two graphs. R is between -1 and 1, where 
                            being close to -1 implies a strong inverse relationship while being close to 1 implies a 
                            strong direct relationship. The closer R is to 1, the higher the similarity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dynamic time warping (DTW): Typical similarity algorithms will compare points on two graphs at the 
                            same x-value. However, there are many times where the two graphs have very similar shapes 
                            but are essentially "shifted" versions of each other. DTW uses dynamic programming with the 
                            following recursive equation: 
                            <p>
                                DTW[i, j] = cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j  ], DTW[i  , j-1], DTW[i-1, j-1]), 
                                cost = |s[i] - t[j]|
                            </p>
                            where DTW[i, j] is the distance between s[1:i] and t[1:j] and s and t are the two line graphs being 
                            compared. You're basically looking at each pair of points in s and t and adding the cost to the 
                            minimum cost of keeping the current point in s, keeping the current point in t, or not keeping either 
                            point.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Custom metric: I made my own metric that calculates a similarity score between two graphs based on 
                            how close potentially corresponding exceptions in each graph are and how similar the magnitudes of 
                            those potentially corresponding exception are.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For hierarchical clustering, we get what the clusters look like for each number of clusters from 1 to n. 
                    We can also do something similar for K-Means where we run the K-Means, setting k as each value from 1 to n 
                    for each iteration. For the final step, we need to determine what number of clusters was optimal. I used 
                    a metric called the Dunn Index which uses both inter-cluster distance and intra-cluster distance in 
                    calculating its clustering score. inter-cluster distance is the distance between clusters and intra-cluster 
                    distance is the distance between points within a cluster.
                    <p>
                        Dunn Index = (minimum inter-cluster distance) / (maximum intra-cluster distance)
                    </p>
                    So why does this formula help us determine what makes a good clustering? Let's first think about what makes 
                    a good clustering. We want our clusters to be distinct and far apart from each other, meaning they should 
                    have high inter-cluster distances. We also want our clusters to be compact, meaning we want low intra-cluster 
                    distances between points. The Dunn Index formula takes the worst case scenario for each of these two ideas, 
                    so the better the worst case scenarios are, the higher the Dunn Index value. The higher the Dunn Index, 
                    the better the clustering is. Notice how a lower maximum intra-cluster distance in the denominator results in a 
                    higher Dunn Index, and how a higher minimum inter-cluster distance in the numerator also results in a 
                    higher Dunn Index. We calculate the Dunn Index for each number of clusters and from there determine which 
                    number of clusters had the highest Dunn Index - this number of clusters will be considered the most optimal 
                    clustering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we have our optimal clustering, we can check each cluster to see if it makes sense using known information. 
                    For instance, many of the clusters I generated grouped several tech companies together, or companies that 
                    relied on similar resources such as oil.

                <div><strong>The Chatbot:</strong></div>
                <p>
                    Rasa is the package we used to train our NLP models and determine how the chatbot should 
                    respond to a user. The first thing we needed to do was figure out what intents our chatbot 
                    should be able to perform. We used Splunk to determine the 30 most used intents on Capital 
                    One's chatbot, Eno. These were the 30 intents that we prioritized, but by the end of the internship,
                    we had 80+ intents completed. Once we had a list of intents to work on, we put training data from 
                    Eno into a spreadsheet and wrote a script to generate the nlu.yml file, which stores training data 
                    for Rasa to train on. It's cool to note that in nlu.yml, not only do you show examples of user 
                    comments that match with each intent, but you also can tell Rasa what the entities, if any, are in 
                    each comment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I go on, I should probably explain what intent and entity recognition are. The intent 
                    is the goal the user is trying to achieve by asking the chatbot something, and entities are
                    details in the user message that are necessary to come up with an answer. Let's say a user 
                    asks the chatbot "What are my last 5 transactions?" The intent here is to Retrieve Transactions. 
                    The only entity here is 5, which is the number of transactions to retrieve. Note that you can also 
                    add other entities such as date of the transaction. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We trained intent recognition models and tested them to make sure they work as expected. We configured 
                    a pipeline to help improve performance. Afterwards, we determined which of our intents were one-shot 
                    answers and worked on matching these answers with their corresponding intents. A one-shot answer is a 
                    pre-defined response that does not have any follow-up. For example, if a user says "Bye!", the
                    chatbot may simply respond with "Bye!". This response is defined in domain.yml and there's no
                    follow-up question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For more complex intents, we wrote Rasa actions in the backend. Actions that require the retrieval 
                    of financial data retrieve the data from Capital One's data orchestrator with GraphQL. That data is 
                    then processed and formulated into a response that is sent back to the frontend for the chatbot to 
                    respond to the user. We also can do entity recognition in these actions. For instance, if you were 
                    looking to retrieve payments on a certain day, an action can use an entity extractor like Duckling to 
                    recognize that day as a date entity and then insert that date into the request for the data orchestrator. 
                    Some actions also make use of something in Rasa called slot values. Suppose a user has multiple accounts.
                    When a user asks for a banking-related intent the first time, the chatbot will ask the user to select 
                    which of their accounts to use. We wrote our actions such that Rasa will then store that account in a slot. 
                    So, the next time the user asks for a banking-related intent, Rasa will default to the account in the slot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rasa also adds enhanced dialogue management, something Eno currently isn't as good at. For example, 
                    suppose a user asks Neo to list their last 5 transactions. The chatbot will respond with those 
                    transactions and then ask if the user wants to see more transactions. From here, there are differnet 
                    routes for the conversation. The user could say yes, no, or straight up ask a different intent. Rasa 
                    allows you to show how each of these scenarios would look in stories.yml. A story is simple one 
                    possible "path" of a conversation. So, Rasa shines in dialogue management because of its ability to 
                    handle various stories.
                </p>
                <div><strong>The Web App:</strong></div>
                <p>
                    React was used to create the entire frontend of the web app. The chat window to communicate with 
                    the chatbot was made with react-chatbot-kit. When a user sends a message to the chatbot, a POST 
                    request in the chatbot's ActionProvider is made to the Rasa backend to get back a response for the 
                    chatbot. In the backend, we created a DynamoDB database to store customer profiles. When you select 
                    another customer profile from the dropdown on the frontend, the chat window is reloaded, and the 
                    details of the current customer profile is pulled from the database and sent to the frontend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Docker was used to containerize the entire application. We setup Docker images for each part of the 
                    codebase (frontend, Rasa, and backend) and used docker-compose to be able to run the web app on a 
                    development server.

                        We presented our web app to senior leaders at Capital One. They were very impressed with the 
                        project - while they asked every other group 1-2 questions, they ended up asking us 8 questions!

                    <li>
                        We also presented our project to our manager's boss who said that they plan to use aspects of 
                        our project in Eno in the future.
                    </li>

                        We successfully made a machine-learning based chatbot. This is important because Eno is currently 
                        rule-based. ML will allow more engaging, dynamic conversations.

                <h5>How Does It All Work? What was the Process?</h5>
                <div><strong>Data Processing and Visualization:</strong></div>
                <p>
                    The first thing that had to be done was to figure out what kinds of forecast data we wanted 
                    to work with. We found that the Reich Lab from the University of Massachusetts was keeping 
                    track of forecast data from a large variety of sources, particularly with data focused on 
                    cumulative and daily deaths, cases, and hospitalizations. So, I wrote some scripts to fetch the 
                    data. Eventually, I also created an additional Github repo and wrote an automation script to 
                    store all the forecast data in case the Reich lab repo stopped storing the data for whatever reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we created the website. We first focused on creating our chart components and making sure 
                    the data was displayed properly. Initially, we used Chart.js but switched to D3.js since D3 allows 
                    for more customized functionality. We also saw that our charts were very jaggedy - this was because 
                    some days tended to see more cases/deaths than others in general. To deal with this, we did two things. 
                    First, we applied a Gaussian transformation to the data. Second, we also used weekly data. Some models 
                    reported weekly forecasts in which only the Gaussian transformation was necessary. For other models that 
                    reported daily predictions, we used the average daily statistic as the value for the weekly forecast. The 
                    same principle was used for confirmed data if the data was daily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I primarily focused on the Top Forecasts part of the web app. This page ranks all the users scores for their 
                    predictions. You can select the type of forecast (cases, deaths, hospitalizations) as well as the time interval 
                    for evaluating forecasts. When you click on a user in the table, you can see all the predictions that user made 
                    on a chart. As you hover left and right over the chart, you will see different predictions from the user.
                </p>
                <div><strong>Scoring Scheme:</strong></div>
                <p>
                    Initially, to simply test the functionality of the web app, we defaulted to MSE as the loss function for 
                    measuring how well a forecast did. However, we quickly realized we need to come up with our own loss function 
                    since there are several nuances with evaluating time series data:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Short-term predictions are easier to make than long-term predictions. Suppose you make predictions 
                            on three consecutive days. Chances are, you may not have predicted well for the long-term, but you 
                            predicted better in the short-term. There are two problems. First, your predictions are overlapping. 
                            Second, the better short-term predictions will accumulate in the final error score. These two things 
                            can result in a score that is better than what the "actual" score should be.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users make different numbers of forecasts. With MSE, users that make more forecasts will tend to have 
                            larger errors. Loss should be accounted for in the scoring scheme, but consistency is also important.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Here's how we dealt with these problems:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If several of your predictions make a prediction for a certain date, only the most recent prediction 
                            for that date will be used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Separate scores are given for different time-intervals. For instance, a time-interval of 1 week means 
                            the score measures how well your forecast predicts one week ahead of time. The intervals we have are 
                            1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and overall. Overall is simply a score calculated by directly lining 
                            up each prediction for a day with the confirmed value for that day. Note that the scoring scheme evaluates 
                            on weekly data. To calculate the scores for the intervals that are not overall, we find the date in the weekly
                            data that is closest to the time-interval.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The scoring scheme adds bias against users who make very few predictions. What this means is that based 
                            on the number of predictions you make, a certain value will be added to your score. This value gets 
                            larger the fewer predictions you make.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Once we get a score, we divide the score by a large constant 
                    to decrease the size of the number to make it easier to read on the frontend.

                <div><strong>Miami Dolphins Project:</strong></div>
                <p>
                    The project I was assigned was to try to come up with some offensive strategies against the New 
                    England Patriots. I used data I found online about the latest game between the Patrios and the Dolphins.
                    However, offensive and defensive formation data was not available, so I watched the entire game and took 
                    notes of the formations of both teams for each play. From there, I used the dataset I created to generate 
                    insights. I looked at the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Pass and run plays
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pass and run plays per down
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Average yardage of each offensive formation and how often each formation was used in the overall 
                            game as well as in each down
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Patriots defensive strategy
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Suggestions for what offensive formations to use and when to use them
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Penalties

                    </ul>
                    I wrote up a two page report and created a brief presentation to share my insights.

                <div><strong>International Champions Cup Project:</strong></div>
                <p>
                    For this project, the International Champions Cup (ICC) organization asked Zenabi to build a model 
                    that could be used to predict attendance at an ICC match. We were given a dataset with 30 previous 
                    ICC matches with data on the two teams that competed, the stadium the match took place, the date of 
                    the match, and the attendance at the match. With very little data, it was quite difficult to try to 
                    build a model that could be used to predict attendance. So, we realized that we would need a lot more 
                    data and test out the use of many different variables to see which variables correlated with attendance. 
                    Variables we tested include Instagram following of the team(s), Instagram followings of the players,
                    Team FIFA ratings, the region and metro populations, the teams market value, match relevancy, and 
                    expected performance score. Match relevancy and expected performance score were metrics we came up with 
                    ourselves. We scrapped the data from various online sources to form our dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we had all our data, we calculated the correlations of each variable with attendance. Match 
                    relevancy, market value, Instagram following had the strongest correlations. Player followings 
                    showed higher correlations than the teams' followings. Next, we created a bunch of machine learning 
                    models in Scikit-learn for regression to see which models performed the best. We also did multivariate 
                    regression for various combinations of variables in R. It turns out that the multivariate regression 
                    models performed the best! In fact, one model even managed to achieve R^2 = 0.79, R = 0.89.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then built a simple web app where you can input two teams and the stadium they play at and get 
                    a prediction on the attendance of the match. The web app was built with basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript 
                    and hosted on an AWS S3 bucket.

                        I got the chance to fly to Miami and talk to various coaching stuff at the Miami Dolphins' training 
                        facility! Even more exciting, the Dolphins ended up beating the Patriots the next game they matched up! 
                        Of course, I don't know if my insights really helped at all, but I certainly learned a good amount about 
                        analytics in sports.

                        Our model for predicted attendance at an ICC match predicted about 5700 seats closer to the actual 
                        attendance compared to the ICC's expectations! Zenabi informed me that the model was sent to the ICC, 
                        so hopefully it's helping them save some potential revenue!

                        brains. We also studied how inhibiting opening of the leak channel in the mitochondria
                        may ameliorate stroke, neurodegenerative and developmental brain diseases. I analyzed
                        images of activity between neurons to collect data for this research project.
